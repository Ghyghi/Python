# Python Learning Journey

This Python learning journey is meant for learning python independent of its frameworks. As such, everything here is simply CLI.

## Structure Explained

- **Topics**: On the roadmap, the segments are divided into 2-week segments. Each segment is a topic.
- **Example Folder**: It contains all the files that I create for experimenting purposes.
- **Practice Tasks**: And the end of every topic is a few practice tasks, but not all of them were attempted on this repo.
